# cs32-final-project

This project will focus on creating an algorithm that analyzes the grocery purchases made by a user to identify what items are purchased regularly, at what interval items are purchased (i.e. I bulk buy rice once a month, but buy milk once a week), and how much of an item is purchased. By analyzing the data, the program should find trends and be able to automatically create a grocery list.

Dream features in this project include giving users the ability to give feedback on the list (i.e. mark an item as irrelevant or put on the list at an inappropriate time, mark an item as missing from the list when it was needed) that would then lead to more accurate results.

For the purposes of this project, I would likely be creating sample data based on my family's grocery data and any other people who may volunteer to help me. One question is whether future iterations of the project could scan receipts or access data from grocery shopping platforms like InstaCart to automate the process of users inputting their grocery data.
